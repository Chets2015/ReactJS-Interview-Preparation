Installation
Let us create a React app using the following command.


$ npx create-react-app myreactapp  
Next, we need to install react-table. We can install react-table via npm command, which is given below.

$ npm install react-table  
Once, we have installed react-table, we need to import the react-table into the react component. To do this, open the src/App.js file and add the following snippet.

import ReactTable from "react-table";  
Let us assume we have data which needs to be rendered using react-table.

const data = [{  
        name: 'Ayaan',  
        age: 26  
        },{  
        name: 'Ahana',  
        age: 22  
        },{  
        name: 'Peter',  
        age: 40   
        },{  
        name: 'Virat',  
        age: 30  
        },{  
        name: 'Rohit',  
        age: 32  
        },{  
        name: 'Dhoni',  
        age: 37  
        }]  
Along with data, we also need to specify the column info with column attributes.

const columns = [{  
       Header: 'Name',  
       accessor: 'name'  
      },{  
      Header: 'Age',  
      accessor: 'age'  
      }]  
Inside the render method, we need to bind this data with react-table and then returns the react-table.

return (  
     <div>  
        <ReactTable  
            data={data}  
            columns={columns}  
            defaultPageSize = {2}  
            pageSizeOptions = {[2,4, 6]}  
         />  
     </div>        
)  
Now, our src/App.js file looks like as below.

import React, { Component } from 'react';  
import ReactTable from "react-table";  
import "react-table/react-table.css";  
  
class App extends Component {  
  render() {  
     const data = [{  
        name: 'Ayaan',  
        age: 26  
        },{  
         name: 'Ahana',  
         age: 22  
         },{  
         name: 'Peter',  
         age: 40      
         },{  
         name: 'Virat',  
         age: 30  
         },{  
         name: 'Rohit',  
         age: 32  
         },{  
         name: 'Dhoni',  
         age: 37  
         }]  
     const columns = [{  
       Header: 'Name',  
       accessor: 'name'  
       },{  
       Header: 'Age',  
       accessor: 'age'  
       }]  
    return (  
          <div>  
              <ReactTable  
                  data={data}  
                  columns={columns}  
                  defaultPageSize = {2}  
                  pageSizeOptions = {[2,4, 6]}  
              />  
          </div>        
    )  
  }  
}  
export default App;  
Output

When we execute the React app, we will get the output as below.

React Table
Now, change the rows dropdown menu, we will get the output as below.
